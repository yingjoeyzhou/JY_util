Note to myself: cleaning up the script used for IEM decoding in the Predictive Brain Lab (PBL). JY_script_IEM.m shows the workflow.

This method is mainly developed by Dr. Pim Mostert, who used to be a PhD student in the lab. Hence, trialfun_PimBH.
Details of the method can be found in Kok, Mostert, & de Lange (2017).
